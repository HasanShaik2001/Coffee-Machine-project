# Coffee-Machine-project

### Defining Requirements and Specifications:
   - Decide on the features your coffee machine will have (e.g., types of coffee, size options, user interface).
   - Specify any constraints such as budget, materials, and components.

### Design Phase:
   - Class Design :-
     - I planned the classes that represent components of the coffee machine (e.g., CoffeeMachine, WaterTank, Heater, Pump).
     - Defining attributes and methods for each class.
   - User Interface Design (Optional):
     - Plan how users will interact with the coffee machine (e.g., command line interface, graphical interface using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt).

### Integration and Testing:
   - Integration: Combine classes and functions to create a functional prototype.
   - Testing: Test each function/method to ensure they work as expected.
   - Use Python's built-in unittest module for writing and running tests.
 

### Deployment (Optional):
   - If applicable, package your Python code using tools like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze.
   - Distribute your coffee machine simulator to users.
